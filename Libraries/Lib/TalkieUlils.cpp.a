   \note The minimal size of the buffer \c s depends on the choice of

   with a minimal length of 8 * sizeof (unsigned int) + 1 characters, i.e. one

   radix will require a smaller minimal buffer size.

   \warning If the buffer is too small, you risk a buffer overflow.

   Conversion is done using the \c radix as base, which may be a
   number between 2 (binary conversion) and up to 36.  If \c radix
   is greater than 10, the next digit after \c '9' will be the letter

    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>

    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.

/** \defgroup avr_inttypes <inttypes.h>: Integer Type conversions
    \code #include <inttypes.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the exact-width integer definitions from
    <tt><stdint.h></tt>, and extends them with additional facilities
    provided by the implementation.

    Currently, the extensions include two additional integer types
    that could hold a "far" pointer (i.e. a code pointer that can
    address more than 64 KB), as well as standard names for all printf
    and scanf formatting options that are supported by the \ref avr_stdio.
    As the library does not support the full range of conversion
    specifiers from ISO 9899:1999, only those conversions that are
    actually implemented will be listed here.

    The idea behind these conversion macros is that, for each of the
    types defined by <stdint.h>, a macro will be supplied that portably
    allows formatting an object of that type in printf() or scanf()
    operations.  Example:

    \code
    #include <inttypes.h>

    uint8_t smallval;
    int32_t longval;
    ...
    printf("The hexadecimal value of smallval is %" PRIx8
           ", the decimal value of longval is %" PRId32 ".\n",
	   smallval, longval);
    \endcode

/** \defgroup avr_io <avr/io.h>: AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.  This is done by diverting to the appropriate
    file <tt>&lt;avr/io</tt><em>XXXX</em><tt>.h&gt;</tt> which should
    never be included directly.  Some register names common to all
    AVR devices are defined directly within <tt>&lt;avr/common.h&gt;</tt>,
    which is included in <tt>&lt;avr/io.h&gt;</tt>,
    but most of the details come from the respective include file.

    Note that this file always includes the following files:
    \code 
    #include <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    #include <avr/portpins.h>
    #include <avr/common.h>
    #include <avr/version.h>
    \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for more details about that header file.

    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that inconsistencies in naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.

    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".

    Finally, the following macros are defined:

    - \b RAMEND
    <br>
    The last on-chip RAM address.
    <br>
    - \b XRAMEND
    <br>
    The last possible RAM location that is addressable. This is equal to 
    RAMEND for devices that do not allow for external RAM. For devices 
    that allow external RAM, this will be larger than RAMEND.
    <br>
    - \b E2END
    <br>
    The last EEPROM address.
    <br>
    - \b FLASHEND
    <br>
    The last byte address in the Flash program space.
    <br>
    - \b SPM_PAGESIZE
    <br>
    For devices with bootloader support, the flash pagesize
    (in bytes) to be used for the \c SPM instruction. 
    - \b E2PAGESIZE
    <br>
    The size of the EEPROM page.

/* avr/sfr_defs.h - macros for accessing AVR special function registers */

/* $Id$ */




/** \defgroup avr_sfr_notes Additional notes from <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    \ingroup avr_sfr

   The \c <avr/sfr_defs.h> file is included by all of the \c <avr/ioXXXX.h>
   files, which use macros defined here to make the special function register
   definitions look like C variables or simple constants, depending on the
   <tt>_SFR_ASM_COMPAT</tt> define.  Some examples from \c <avr/iocanxx.h> to
   show how to define such macros:

\code
#define PORTA   _SFR_IO8(0x02)
#define EEAR    _SFR_IO16(0x21)
#define UDR0    _SFR_MEM8(0xC6)
#define TCNT3   _SFR_MEM16(0x94)
#define CANIDT  _SFR_MEM32(0xF0)
\endcode

   If \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT is not defined, C programs can use names like
   <tt>PORTA</tt> directly in C expressions (also on the left side of
   assignment operators) and GCC will do the right thing (use short I/O
   instructions if possible).  The \c __SFR_OFFSET definition is not used in
   any way in this case.

   Define \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT as 1 to make these names work as simple constants
   (addresses of the I/O registers).  This is necessary when included in
   preprocessed assembler (*.S) source files, so it is done automatically if
   \c __ASSEMBLER__ is defined.  By default, all addresses are defined as if
   they were memory addresses (used in \c lds/sts instructions).  To use these
   addresses in \c in/out instructions, you must subtract 0x20 from them.

   For more backwards compatibility, insert the following at the start of your
   old assembler source file:

\code
#define __SFR_OFFSET 0
\endcode

   This automatically subtracts 0x20 from I/O space addresses, but it's a
   hack, so it is recommended to change your source: wrap such addresses in
   macros defined here, as shown below.  After this is done, the
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> definition is no longer necessary and can be removed.

   Real example - this code could be used in a boot loader that is portable
   between devices with \c SPMCR at different addresses.

\verbatim
<avr/iom163.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_IO8(0x37)
<avr/iom128.h>: #define SPMCR _SFR_MEM8(0x68)
\endverbatim

\code
#if _SFR_IO_REG_P(SPMCR)
	out	_SFR_IO_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
#else
	sts	_SFR_MEM_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
#endif
\endcode

   You can use the \c in/out/cbi/sbi/sbic/sbis instructions, without the
   <tt>_SFR_IO_REG_P</tt> test, if you know that the register is in the I/O
   space (as with \c SREG, for example).  If it isn't, the assembler will
   complain (I/O address out of range 0...0x3f), so this should be fairly
   safe.

   If you do not define \c __SFR_OFFSET (so it will be 0x20 by default), all
   special register addresses are defined as memory addresses (so \c SREG is
   0x5f), and (if code size and speed are not important, and you don't like
   the ugly \#if above) you can always use lds/sts to access them.  But, this
   will not work if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> != 0x20, so use a different macro
   (defined only if <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> == 0x20) for safety:

\code
	sts	_SFR_ADDR(SPMCR), r24
\endcode

   In C programs, all 3 combinations of \c _SFR_ASM_COMPAT and
   <tt>__SFR_OFFSET</tt> are supported - the \c _SFR_ADDR(SPMCR) macro can be
   used to get the address of the \c SPMCR register (0x57 or 0x68 depending on
   device). */

/** \defgroup avr_fuse <avr/fuse.h>: Fuse Support

    \par Introduction

    The Fuse API allows a user to specify the fuse settings for the specific
    AVR device they are compiling for. These fuse settings will be placed
    in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.

    Programming tools can take advantage of the fuse information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the fuses
    need to be programmed before programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 

    To use the Fuse API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/fuse.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    fuses.
    
    \par Fuse API
    
    Each I/O header file must define the FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro which is
    defined to the number of fuse bytes that exist in the AVR device.
    
    A new type, __fuse_t, is defined as a structure. The number of fields in 
    this structure are determined by the number of fuse bytes in the 
    FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE macro.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 1, there is only a single field: byte, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 2, there are two fields: low, and high, of type
    unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE == 3, there are three fields: low, high, and extended,
    of type unsigned char.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, there is a single field: byte, which is an array
    of unsigned char with the size of the array being FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE.
    
    A convenience macro, FUSEMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".fuse".
    
    A convenience macro, FUSES, is defined that declares a variable, __fuse, of
    type __fuse_t with the attribute defined by FUSEMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the fuse data.

    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined FUSEMEM,
    then FUSEMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined FUSES, then FUSES is not redefined.

    Each AVR device I/O header file has a set of defined macros which specify the
    actual fuse bits available on that device. The AVR fuses have inverted
    values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a
    programmed (enabled) bit. The defined macros for each individual fuse
    bit represent this in their definition by a bit-wise inversion of a mask.
    For example, the FUSE_EESAVE fuse in the ATmega128 is defined as:
    \code
    #define FUSE_EESAVE      ~_BV(3)
    \endcode
    \note The _BV macro creates a bit mask from a bit number. It is then 
    inverted to represent logical values for a fuse memory byte.
    
    To combine the fuse bits macros together to represent a whole fuse byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN)
    \endcode
    
    Each device I/O header file also defines macros that provide default values
    for each fuse byte that is available. LFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a Low
    Fuse byte. HFUSE_DEFAULT is defined for a High Fuse byte. EFUSE_DEFAULT
    is defined for an Extended Fuse byte.
    
    If FUSE_MEMORY_SIZE > 3, then the I/O header file defines macros that
    provide default values for each fuse byte like so:
    FUSE0_DEFAULT
    FUSE1_DEFAULT
    FUSE2_DEFAULT
    FUSE3_DEFAULT
    FUSE4_DEFAULT
    ....
    
    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy. Using C99's designated initializers:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    FUSES = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or, using the variable directly instead of the FUSES macro,
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    __fuse_t __fuse __attribute__((section (".fuse"))) = 
    {
        .low = LFUSE_DEFAULT,
        .high = (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN),
        .extended = EFUSE_DEFAULT,
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    If you are compiling in C++, you cannot use the designated intializers so
    you must do:

    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    FUSES = 
    {
        LFUSE_DEFAULT, // .low
        (FUSE_BOOTSZ0 & FUSE_BOOTSZ1 & FUSE_EESAVE & FUSE_SPIEN & FUSE_JTAGEN), // .high
        EFUSE_DEFAULT, // .extended
    };

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    
    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The FUSES macro defines a global variable to store the fuse data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired fuse 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .fuse section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .fuse section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the FUSES macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize ALL fields in the __fuse_t structure. This is because
    the fuse bits in all bytes default to a logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. 
    Normal uninitialized data defaults to all locgial zeros. So it is vital that
    all fuse bytes are initialized, even with default data. If they are not,
    then the fuse bits may not programmed to the desired settings.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.

    You can print out the contents of the .fuse section in the ELF file by
    using this command line:
    \code
    avr-objdump -s -j .fuse <ELF file>
    \endcode
    The section contents shows the address on the left, then the data going from
    lower address to a higher address, left to right.

/** \defgroup avr_lock <avr/lock.h>: Lockbit Support

    \par Introduction

    The Lockbit API allows a user to specify the lockbit settings for the 
    specific AVR device they are compiling for. These lockbit settings will be 
    placed in a special section in the ELF output file, after linking.

    Programming tools can take advantage of the lockbit information embedded in
    the ELF file, by extracting this information and determining if the lockbits
    need to be programmed after programming the Flash and EEPROM memories.
    This also allows a single ELF file to contain all the
    information needed to program an AVR. 

    To use the Lockbit API, include the <avr/io.h> header file, which in turn
    automatically includes the individual I/O header file and the <avr/lock.h>
    file. These other two files provides everything necessary to set the AVR
    lockbits.
    
    \par Lockbit API
    
    Each I/O header file may define up to 3 macros that controls what kinds
    of lockbits are available to the user.
    
    If __LOCK_BITS_EXIST is defined, then two lock bits are available to the
    user and 3 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_0_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB0 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BITS_1_EXIST is defined, then the two BLB1 lock bits are
    available to the user and 4 mode settings are defined for these two bits.

    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_TABLE_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits
    are available to set the locking mode for the Application Table Section 
    (which is used in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_APPLICATION_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are
    available to set the locking mode for the Application Section (which is used
    in the XMEGA family).
    
    If __BOOT_LOCK_BOOT_BITS_EXIST is defined then two lock bits are available
    to set the locking mode for the Boot Loader Section (which is used in the
    XMEGA family).

    The AVR lockbit modes have inverted values, logical 1 for an unprogrammed 
    (disabled) bit and logical 0 for a programmed (enabled) bit. The defined 
    macros for each individual lock bit represent this in their definition by a 
    bit-wise inversion of a mask. For example, the LB_MODE_3 macro is defined 
    as:
    \code
    #define LB_MODE_3  (0xFC)
`   \endcode
    
    To combine the lockbit mode macros together to represent a whole byte,
    use the bitwise AND operator, like so:
    \code
    (LB_MODE_3 & BLB0_MODE_2)
    \endcode
    
    <avr/lock.h> also defines a macro that provides a default lockbit value:
    LOCKBITS_DEFAULT which is defined to be 0xFF.

    See the AVR device specific datasheet for more details about these
    lock bits and the available mode settings.
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKMEM, is defined as a GCC attribute for a 
    custom-named section of ".lock".
    
    A convenience macro, LOCKBITS, is defined that declares a variable, __lock, 
    of type unsigned char with the attribute defined by LOCKMEM. This variable
    allows the end user to easily set the lockbit data.

    \note If a device-specific I/O header file has previously defined LOCKMEM,
    then LOCKMEM is not redefined. If a device-specific I/O header file has
    previously defined LOCKBITS, then LOCKBITS is not redefined. LOCKBITS is
    currently known to be defined in the I/O header files for the XMEGA devices.

    \par API Usage Example
    
    Putting all of this together is easy:
    
    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>

    LOCKBITS = (LB_MODE_1 & BLB0_MODE_3 & BLB1_MODE_4);

    int main(void)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    \endcode
    
    Or:

    However there are a number of caveats that you need to be aware of to
    use this API properly.
    
    Be sure to include <avr/io.h> to get all of the definitions for the API.
    The LOCKBITS macro defines a global variable to store the lockbit data. This 
    variable is assigned to its own linker section. Assign the desired lockbit 
    values immediately in the variable initialization.
    
    The .lock section in the ELF file will get its values from the initial 
    variable assignment ONLY. This means that you can NOT assign values to 
    this variable in functions and the new values will not be put into the
    ELF .lock section.
    
    The global variable is declared in the LOCKBITS macro has two leading 
    underscores, which means that it is reserved for the "implementation",
    meaning the library, so it will not conflict with a user-named variable.
    
    You must initialize the lockbit variable to some meaningful value, even
    if it is the default value. This is because the lockbits default to a 
    logical 1, meaning unprogrammed. Normal uninitialized data defaults to all 
    locgial zeros. So it is vital that all lockbits are initialized, even with 
    default data. If they are not, then the lockbits may not programmed to the 
    desired settings and can possibly put your device into an unrecoverable 
    state.
    
    Be sure to have the -mmcu=<em>device</em> flag in your compile command line and
    your linker command line to have the correct device selected and to have 
    the correct I/O header file included when you include <avr/io.h>.

    You can print out the contents of the .lock section in the ELF file by
    using this command line:
    \code
    avr-objdump -s -j .lock <ELF file>
    \endcode

    \def pgm_get_far_address(var)

   This macro facilitates the obtention of a 32 bit "far" pointer (only 24 bits
   used) to data even passed the 64KB limit for the 16 bit ordinary pointer. It
   is similar to the '&' operator, with some limitations.

   Comments:

   - The overhead is minimal and it's mainly due to the 32 bit size operation.

   - 24 bit sizes guarantees the code compatibility for use in future devices.

   - hh8() is an undocumented feature but seems to give the third significant byte
     of a 32 bit data and accepts symbols, complementing the functionality of hi8()
     and lo8(). There is not an equivalent assembler function to get the high
     significant byte.

   - 'var' has to be resolved at linking time as an existing symbol, i.e, a simple
     type variable name, an array name (not an indexed element of the array, if the
     index is a constant the compiler does not complain but fails to get the address
     if optimization is enabled), a struct name or a struct field name, a function
     identifier, a linker defined identifier,...

   - The returned value is the identifier's VMA (virtual memory address) determined
     by the linker and falls in the corresponding memory region. The AVR Harvard
     architecture requires non overlapping VMA areas for the multiple address spaces
     in the processor: Flash ROM, RAM, and EEPROM. Typical offset for this are
     0x00000000, 0x00800xx0, and 0x00810000 respectively, derived from the linker
     script used and linker options. The value returned can be seen then as a
     universal pointer.

    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>

    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.

/** \defgroup avr_stdio <stdio.h>: Standard IO facilities
    \code #include <stdio.h> \endcode

    <h3>Introduction to the Standard IO facilities</h3>

    This file declares the standard IO facilities that are implemented
    in \c avr-libc.  Due to the nature of the underlying hardware,
    only a limited subset of standard IO is implemented.  There is no
    actual file implementation available, so only device IO can be
    performed.  Since there's no operating system, the application
    needs to provide enough details about their devices in order to
    make them usable by the standard IO facilities.

    Due to space constraints, some functionality has not been
    implemented at all (like some of the \c printf conversions that
    have been left out).  Nevertheless, potential users of this
    implementation should be warned: the \c printf and \c scanf families of functions, although
    usually associated with presumably simple things like the
    famous "Hello, world!" program, are actually fairly complex
    which causes their inclusion to eat up a fair amount of code space.
    Also, they are not fast due to the nature of interpreting the
    format string at run-time.  Whenever possible, resorting to the
    (sometimes non-standard) predetermined conversion facilities that are
    offered by avr-libc will usually cost much less in terms of speed
    and code size.

    <h3>Tunable options for code size vs. feature set</h3>

    In order to allow programmers a code size vs. functionality tradeoff,
    the function vfprintf() which is the heart of the printf family can be
    selected in different flavours using linker options.  See the
    documentation of vfprintf() for a detailed description.  The same
    applies to vfscanf() and the \c scanf family of functions.

    <h3>Outline of the chosen API</h3>

    The standard streams \c stdin, \c stdout, and \c stderr are
    provided, but contrary to the C standard, since avr-libc has no
    knowledge about applicable devices, these streams are not already
    pre-initialized at application startup.  Also, since there is no
    notion of "file" whatsoever to avr-libc, there is no function
    \c fopen() that could be used to associate a stream to some device.
    (See \ref stdio_note1 "note 1".)  Instead, the function \c fdevopen()
    is provided to associate a stream to a device, where the device
    needs to provide a function to send a character, to receive a
    character, or both.  There is no differentiation between "text" and
    "binary" streams inside avr-libc.  Character \c \\n is sent
    literally down to the device's \c put() function.  If the device
    requires a carriage return (\c \\r) character to be sent before
    the linefeed, its \c put() routine must implement this (see
    \ref stdio_note2 "note 2").

    As an alternative method to fdevopen(), the macro
    fdev_setup_stream() might be used to setup a user-supplied FILE
    structure.

    It should be noted that the automatic conversion of a newline
    character into a carriage return - newline sequence breaks binary
    transfers.  If binary transfers are desired, no automatic
    conversion should be performed, but instead any string that aims
    to issue a CR-LF sequence must use <tt>"\r\n"</tt> explicitly.

    For convenience, the first call to \c fdevopen() that opens a
    stream for reading will cause the resulting stream to be aliased
    to \c stdin.  Likewise, the first call to \c fdevopen() that opens
    a stream for writing will cause the resulting stream to be aliased
    to both, \c stdout, and \c stderr.  Thus, if the open was done
    with both, read and write intent, all three standard streams will
    be identical.  Note that these aliases are indistinguishable from
    each other, thus calling \c fclose() on such a stream will also
    effectively close all of its aliases (\ref stdio_note3 "note 3").

    It is possible to tie additional user data to a stream, using
    fdev_set_udata().  The backend put and get functions can then
    extract this user data using fdev_get_udata(), and act
    appropriately.  For example, a single put function could be used
    to talk to two different UARTs that way, or the put and get
    functions could keep internal state between calls there.

    <h3>Format strings in flash ROM</h3>

    All the \c printf and \c scanf family functions come in two flavours: the
    standard name, where the format string is expected to be in
    SRAM, as well as a version with the suffix "_P" where the format
    string is expected to reside in the flash ROM.  The macro
    \c PSTR (explained in \ref avr_pgmspace) becomes very handy
    for declaring these format strings.

    \anchor stdio_without_malloc
    <h3>Running stdio without malloc()</h3>

    By default, fdevopen() requires malloc().  As this is often
    not desired in the limited environment of a microcontroller, an
    alternative option is provided to run completely without malloc().

    The macro fdev_setup_stream() is provided to prepare a
    user-supplied FILE buffer for operation with stdio.

    <h4>Example</h4>

    \code
    #include <stdio.h>

    static int uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream);

    static FILE mystdout = FDEV_SETUP_STREAM(uart_putchar, NULL,
                                             _FDEV_SETUP_WRITE);

    static int
    uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream)
    {

      if (c == '\n')
        uart_putchar('\r', stream);
      loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSRA, UDRE);
      UDR = c;
      return 0;
    }

    int
    main(void)
    {
      init_uart();
      stdout = &mystdout;
      printf("Hello, world!\n");

      return 0;
    }
    \endcode

    This example uses the initializer form FDEV_SETUP_STREAM() rather
    than the function-like fdev_setup_stream(), so all data
    initialization happens during C start-up.

    If streams initialized that way are no longer needed, they can be
    destroyed by first calling the macro fdev_close(), and then
    destroying the object itself.  No call to fclose() should be
    issued for these streams.  While calling fclose() itself is
    harmless, it will cause an undefined reference to free() and thus
    cause the linker to link the malloc module into the application.

    <h3>Notes</h3>

    \anchor stdio_note1 \par Note 1:
    It might have been possible to implement a device abstraction that
    is compatible with \c fopen() but since this would have required
    to parse a string, and to take all the information needed either
    out of this string, or out of an additional table that would need to be
    provided by the application, this approach was not taken.

    \anchor stdio_note2 \par Note 2:
    This basically follows the Unix approach: if a device such as a
    terminal needs special handling, it is in the domain of the
    terminal device driver to provide this functionality.  Thus, a
    simple function suitable as \c put() for \c fdevopen() that talks
    to a UART interface might look like this:

    \code
    int
    uart_putchar(char c, FILE *stream)
    {

      if (c == '\n')
        uart_putchar('\r');
      loop_until_bit_is_set(UCSRA, UDRE);
      UDR = c;
      return 0;
    }
    \endcode

    \anchor stdio_note3 \par Note 3:
    This implementation has been chosen because the cost of maintaining
    an alias is considerably smaller than the cost of maintaining full
    copies of each stream.  Yet, providing an implementation that offers
    the complete set of standard streams was deemed to be useful.  Not
    only that writing \c printf() instead of <tt>fprintf(mystream, ...)</tt>
    saves typing work, but since avr-gcc needs to resort to pass all
    arguments of variadic functions on the stack (as opposed to passing
    them in registers for functions that take a fixed number of
    parameters), the ability to pass one parameter less by implying
    \c stdin or stdout will also save some execution time.

/**
   \c vfprintf is the central facility of the \c printf family of
   functions.  It outputs values to \c stream under control of a
   format string passed in \c fmt.  The actual values to print are
   passed as a variable argument list \c ap.

   \c vfprintf returns the number of characters written to \c stream,
   or \c EOF in case of an error.  Currently, this will only happen
   if \c stream has not been opened with write intent.

   The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
   characters (not \c %), which are copied unchanged to the output
   stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in
   fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.  Each conversion
   specification is introduced by the \c % character.  The arguments must
   properly correspond (after type promotion) with the conversion
   specifier.  After the \c %, the following appear in sequence:

   - Zero or more of the following flags:
      <ul>
      <li> \c # The value should be converted to an "alternate form".  For
            c, d, i, s, and u conversions, this option has no effect.
            For o conversions, the precision of the number is
            increased to force the first character of the output
            string to a zero (except if a zero value is printed with
            an explicit precision of zero).  For x and X conversions,
            a non-zero result has the string `0x' (or `0X' for X
            conversions) prepended to it.</li>
      <li> \c 0 (zero) Zero padding.  For all conversions, the converted
            value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.
            If a precision is given with a numeric conversion (d, i,
            o, u, i, x, and X), the 0 flag is ignored.</li>
      <li> \c - A negative field width flag; the converted value is to be
            left adjusted on the field boundary.  The converted value
            is padded on the right with blanks, rather than on the
            left with blanks or zeros.  A - overrides a 0 if both are
            given.</li>
      <li> ' ' (space) A blank should be left before a positive number
            produced by a signed conversion (d, or i).</li>
      <li> \c + A sign must always be placed before a number produced by a
            signed conversion.  A + overrides a space if both are
            used.</li>
      </ul>
      
   -   An optional decimal digit string specifying a minimum field width.
       If the converted value has fewer characters than the field width, it
       will be padded with spaces on the left (or right, if the left-adjustment
       flag has been given) to fill out the field width.
   -   An optional precision, in the form of a period . followed by an
       optional digit string.  If the digit string is omitted, the
       precision is taken as zero.  This gives the minimum number of
       digits to appear for d, i, o, u, x, and X conversions, or the
       maximum number of characters to be printed from a string for \c s
       conversions.
   -   An optional \c l or \c h length modifier, that specifies that the
       argument for the d, i, o, u, x, or X conversion is a \c "long int"
       rather than \c int. The \c h is ignored, as \c "short int" is
       equivalent to \c int.
   -   A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.

   The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

   - \c diouxX The int (or appropriate variant) argument is converted
           to signed decimal (d and i), unsigned octal (o), unsigned
           decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.
           The letters "abcdef" are used for x conversions; the
           letters "ABCDEF" are used for X conversions.  The
           precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that
           must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits,
           it is padded on the left with zeros.
   - \c p  The <tt>void *</tt> argument is taken as an unsigned integer,
           and converted similarly as a <tt>%\#x</tt> command would do.
   - \c c  The \c int argument is converted to an \c "unsigned char", and the
           resulting character is written.
   - \c s  The \c "char *" argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
           of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from
           the array are written up to (but not including) a
           terminating NUL character; if a precision is specified, no
           more than the number specified are written.  If a precision
           is given, no null character need be present; if the
           precision is not specified, or is greater than the size of
           the array, the array must contain a terminating NUL
           character.
   - \c %  A \c % is written.  No argument is converted.  The complete
           conversion specification is "%%".
   - \c eE The double argument is rounded and converted in the format
           \c "[-]d.ddde±dd" where there is one digit before the
           decimal-point character and the number of digits after it
           is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it
           is taken as 6; if the precision is zero, no decimal-point
           character appears.  An \e E conversion uses the letter \c 'E'
           (rather than \c 'e') to introduce the exponent.  The exponent
           always contains two digits; if the value is zero,
           the exponent is 00.
   - \c fF The double argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation
           in the format \c "[-]ddd.ddd", where the number of digits after the
           decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification.
           If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision
           is explicitly zero, no decimal-point character appears.  If a
           decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.
   - \c gG The double argument is converted in style \c f or \c e (or
           \c F or \c E for \c G conversions).  The precision
           specifies the number of significant digits.  If the
           precision is missing, 6 digits are given; if the precision
           is zero, it is treated as 1.  Style \c e is used if the
           exponent from its conversion is less than -4 or greater
           than or equal to the precision.  Trailing zeros are removed
           from the fractional part of the result; a decimal point
           appears only if it is followed by at least one digit.
   - \c S  Similar to the \c s format, except the pointer is expected to
           point to a program-memory (ROM) string instead of a RAM string.

   In no case does a non-existent or small field width cause truncation of a
   numeric field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field
   width, the field is expanded to contain the conversion result.

   Since the full implementation of all the mentioned features becomes
   fairly large, three different flavours of vfprintf() can be
   selected using linker options.  The default vfprintf() implements
   all the mentioned functionality except floating point conversions.
   A minimized version of vfprintf() is available that only implements
   the very basic integer and string conversion facilities, but only
   the \c # additional option can be specified using conversion
   flags (these flags are parsed correctly from the format
   specification, but then simply ignored).  This version can be
   requested using the following \ref gcc_minusW "compiler options":

   \code
   -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_min
   \endcode

   If the full functionality including the floating point conversions
   is required, the following options should be used:

   \code
   -Wl,-u,vfprintf -lprintf_flt -lm
   \endcode

   \par Limitations:
   - The specified width and precision can be at most 255.

   \par Notes:
   - For floating-point conversions, if you link default or minimized
     version of vfprintf(), the symbol \c ? will be output and double
     argument will be skiped. So you output below will not be crashed.
     For default version the width field and the "pad to left" ( symbol
     minus ) option will work in this case.
   - The \c hh length modifier is ignored (\c char argument is
     promouted to \c int). More exactly, this realization does not check
     the number of \c h symbols.
   - But the \c ll length modifier will to abort the output, as this
     realization does not operate \c long \c long arguments.
   - The variable width or precision field (an asterisk \c * symbol)
     is not realized and will to abort the output.

    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>

    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.

/** \defgroup avr_io <avr/io.h>: AVR device-specific IO definitions
    \code #include <avr/io.h> \endcode

    This header file includes the apropriate IO definitions for the
    device that has been specified by the <tt>-mmcu=</tt> compiler
    command-line switch.  This is done by diverting to the appropriate
    file <tt>&lt;avr/io</tt><em>XXXX</em><tt>.h&gt;</tt> which should
    never be included directly.  Some register names common to all
    AVR devices are defined directly within <tt>&lt;avr/common.h&gt;</tt>,
    which is included in <tt>&lt;avr/io.h&gt;</tt>,
    but most of the details come from the respective include file.

    Note that this file always includes the following files:
    \code 
    #include <avr/sfr_defs.h>
    #include <avr/portpins.h>
    #include <avr/common.h>
    #include <avr/version.h>
    \endcode
    See \ref avr_sfr for more details about that header file.

    Included are definitions of the IO register set and their
    respective bit values as specified in the Atmel documentation.
    Note that inconsistencies in naming conventions,
    so even identical functions sometimes get different names on
    different devices.

    Also included are the specific names useable for interrupt
    function definitions as documented
    \ref avr_signames "here".

    Finally, the following macros are defined:

    - \b RAMEND
    <br>
    The last on-chip RAM address.
    <br>
    - \b XRAMEND
    <br>
    The last possible RAM location that is addressable. This is equal to 
    RAMEND for devices that do not allow for external RAM. For devices 
    that allow external RAM, this will be larger than RAMEND.
    <br>
    - \b E2END
    <br>
    The last EEPROM address.
    <br>
    - \b FLASHEND
    <br>
    The last byte address in the Flash program space.
    <br>
    - \b SPM_PAGESIZE
    <br>
    For devices with bootloader support, the flash pagesize
    (in bytes) to be used for the \c SPM instruction. 
    - \b E2PAGESIZE
    <br>
    The size of the EEPROM page.

/** \defgroup avr_eeprom <avr/eeprom.h>: EEPROM handling
    \code #include <avr/eeprom.h> \endcode

    This header file declares the interface to some simple library
    routines suitable for handling the data EEPROM contained in the
    AVR microcontrollers.  The implementation uses a simple polled
    mode interface.  Applications that require interrupt-controlled
    EEPROM access to ensure that no time will be wasted in spinloops
    will have to deploy their own implementation.

    \par Notes:

    - In addition to the write functions there is a set of update ones.
    This functions read each byte first and skip the burning if the
    old value is the same with new.  The scaning direction is from
    high address to low, to obtain quick return in common cases.

    - All of the read/write functions first make sure the EEPROM is
    ready to be accessed.  Since this may cause long delays if a
    write operation is still pending, time-critical applications
    should first poll the EEPROM e. g. using eeprom_is_ready() before
    attempting any actual I/O.  But this functions are not wait until
    SELFPRGEN in SPMCSR becomes zero.  Do this manually, if your
    softwate contains the Flash burning.

    - As these functions modify IO registers, they are known to be
    non-reentrant.  If any of these functions are used from both,
    standard and interrupt context, the applications must ensure
    proper protection (e.g. by disabling interrupts before accessing
    them).

    - All write functions force erase_and_write programming mode.
    
    - For Xmega the EEPROM start address is 0, like other architectures.
    The reading functions add the 0x2000 value to use EEPROM mapping into
    data space.

    The functions in this header file implement simple delay loops
    that perform a busy-waiting.  They are typically used to
    facilitate short delays in the program execution.  They are
    implemented as count-down loops with a well-known CPU cycle
    count per loop iteration.  As such, no other processing can
    occur simultaneously.  It should be kept in mind that the
    functions described here do not disable interrupts.

    In general, for long delays, the use of hardware timers is
    much preferrable, as they free the CPU, and allow for
    concurrent processing of other events while the timer is
    running.  However, in particular for very short delays, the
    overhead of setting up a hardware timer is too much compared
    to the overall delay time.

    Two inline functions are provided for the actual delay algorithms.

    \note As an alternative method, it is possible to pass the
    F_CPU macro down to the compiler from the Makefile.
    Obviously, in that case, no \c \#define statement should be
    used.

    The functions in this header file are wrappers around the basic
    busy-wait functions from <util/delay_basic.h>.  They are meant as
    convenience functions where actual time values can be specified
    rather than a number of cycles to wait for.  The idea behind is
    that compile-time constant expressions will be eliminated by
    compiler optimization so floating-point expressions can be used
    to calculate the number of delay cycles needed based on the CPU
    frequency passed by the macro F_CPU.

    \note In order for these functions to work as intended, compiler
    optimizations <em>must</em> be enabled, and the delay time
    <em>must</em> be an expression that is a known constant at
    compile-time.  If these requirements are not met, the resulting
    delay will be much longer (and basically unpredictable), and
    applications that otherwise do not use floating-point calculations
    will experience severe code bloat by the floating-point library
    routines linked into the application.

    The functions available allow the specification of microsecond, and
    millisecond delays directly, using the application-supplied macro
    F_CPU as the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz).

/**
   \ingroup util_delay

   Perform a delay of \c __ms milliseconds, using _delay_loop_2().

   The macro F_CPU is supposed to be defined to a
   constant defining the CPU clock frequency (in Hertz).

   The maximal possible delay is 262.14 ms / F_CPU in MHz.

   When the user request delay which exceed the maximum possible one,
   _delay_ms() provides a decreased resolution functionality. In this
   mode _delay_ms() will work with a resolution of 1/10 ms, providing
   delays up to 6.5535 seconds (independent from CPU frequency).  The
   user will not be informed about decreased resolution.

   If the avr-gcc toolchain has __builtin_avr_delay_cycles()
   support, maximal possible delay is 4294967.295 ms/ F_CPU in MHz. For
   values greater than the maximal possible delay, overflows results in
   no delay i.e., 0ms.

   Conversion of \c __ms into clock cycles may not always result in
   integer.  By default, the clock cycles rounded up to next
   integer. This ensures that the user gets at least \c __ms
   microseconds of delay.

   Alternatively, by defining the macro \c __DELAY_ROUND_DOWN__, or
   \c __DELAY_ROUND_CLOSEST__, before including this header file, the
   algorithm can be made to round down, or round to closest integer,
   respectively.

   \note

   The implementation of _delay_ms() based on
   __builtin_avr_delay_cycles() is not backward compatible with older
   implementations.  In order to get functionality backward compatible
   with previous versions, the macro \c "__DELAY_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE__"
   must be defined before including this header file. Also, the
   backward compatible algorithm will be chosen if the code is
   compiled in a <em>freestanding environment</em> (GCC option
   \c -ffreestanding), as the math functions required for rounding are
   not available to the compiler then.

    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>

    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.
